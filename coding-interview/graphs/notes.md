## Bipartite Graph

A kind of graph where the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets U and V.
No vertex of U is adjacent to any other vertex in U.
No vertex of V is adjacent to any other vertex in V.
Vertices in U have edges that connect it to vertices in V.
All cycle graphs or graphs of some vertices connected in a close chain are bipartite.
A graph cannot be bipartite if there are an odd number of vertices and it has an odd cycle.
Complete bipartite graph: connects each vertex from U to each vertex of V.
Start graph: is a complete bipartite graph if a single vertex belongs to one set, and all remaining vertices belong to the other set.
Acyclic graph: a graph with no cycles.
